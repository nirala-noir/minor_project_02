topic  is pdf/resume classification based on company requirement

base model:: 
(c++) thoughts;
i created a map which contains person name as keys based on values are in a vector of skills to that particular.

iterate through company name and traverse throught each company's requirement , so, for company first requirement , 
we will see which person/key has skills of this particular we are searching for. 
after getting we will create a map of company (key) and student (values) in a vector which tell all the students with necessary skills for respective company.

thankyou; further updates will be continued 07-11-21
